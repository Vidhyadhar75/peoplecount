# **People Counting System using OpenCV**

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project uses **OpenCV and Python** to count the number of people entering and exiting a designated area. It applies **object detection and tracking** techniques to analyze real-time video streams from a webcam or CCTV feed.

## ðŸš€ Features  
- **Real-time people detection and tracking**  
- **Entry and exit counting mechanism**  
- **Live video processing using OpenCV**  
- **Scalable for multiple environments (offices, malls, etc.)**  

## ðŸ“‚ Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vidhyadhar75/peoplecount.git  
   cd peoplecount 
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy
   ```  

## ðŸ›  Usage  

1. Ensure your webcam is connected or a video feed is available.  
2. Run the tracking script:  
   ```bash
   python test.py  
   ```  
3. The system will display a live feed with a **count overlay**.  

## ðŸ“Š How It Works  
1. **Reads frames** from the webcam/video source.  
2. **Applies object detection** to identify people.  
3. **Tracks movement** across a predefined entry/exit line.  
4. **Increments or decrements** the people count based on movement direction.  
5. **Displays live count** on the screen.  

## ðŸ¤– Technologies Used  
- OpenCV  
- Python  
- Computer Vision  

## âš¡ Future Enhancements  
- Integrate **deep learning models** for improved accuracy.  
- Add **cloud-based storage** for logging counts over time.  
- Implement **edge computing** for IoT applications.  

## ðŸ“Œ Contribution  
Pull requests are welcome! Help improve detection accuracy and add new features.
